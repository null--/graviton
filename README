GraVitoN project has been (temporarily) suspended due to...

# Project:
  GraVitoN: A Cross Platform Malware Development Framework
  (Now available on both savannah and github)

# Version Info:
  2.0.0.-1

# Code Name:
  Scream of Pain

# Some Key Notes:
  0- Use doxygen to generate documentation. (There is a Doxyfile inside graviton/ folder)
  1- Always build external libraries statically
  2- Before using a class or function from GraVitoN lib, make sure that you know it's dependencies.
    (e.g. SSL_Client depends on openssl so you should link openssl's 
    static library (.a or .lib) to your project.)
  99- There are rules to be broken.

# ------------------------- Statement Of Agreement ------------------------- #
	
As a developer/hacker/user of The GraVitoN Project, by downloading any part of 
this framework, I understand my duties and responibilities include the following:

1. Responsibility:
  1.a) I will not use this framework to launch an illegal attack vector
  against any individual/legal entity, and if I do, I'm the
  only person who is legaly responsible for, and NOT The GraVitoN Community.
	
2. Benevolent Use:
  2.a) I will develope/hack/use GraVitoN framework, for educational purpose, research
  and/or legal penetration tests.


# ------------------------- TODO ------------------------- #
Lots of code, lots of test

OP - #Breakthrought:
  OOP:
    Utils:
      Crypto
      File & Directory: UNICODE (wchar_t) Support
  Malkit:
    UPX
    Graver (Continue Dev. in C++ or Rewrite in Lua)
  Core::Memory:
    Payload
    Infect

Major:
  - graver
  - build static library: <type>statlib</type>    
  - mingw x86_64
  - msvc x86_64
  - clang x86_64
  - Low-level: C++, High-level: Lua
  - ms12-20
  - Build static lib files (.a, .lib) of external libraries for linux (32/64) and windows (32/64)
  - code a cross platform raw socket lib
  - metasploit plugin
  - metaworm master/slave
  - exploit-and-infect shellcode
  - android/ios/osx test
  - Documentation
  - code a polymorphic engine (binary and source)
  - lua script encrypter/decrypter modules
  - SolarWind
  - Injection and Hooking techniques (win: IAT, SSDT)
  - Check possibility of compiling GraVitoN as nt driver and kernel module driver (targeting ring #0)
    
Minor:
  - Combine luabridge with components ---> IN PROGRESS
  - mini http(s) web server
    
and a lot more!
